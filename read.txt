Calc*ulus is the mathematical s*tudy of contin*uous cha*nge, in the same way that ge*ometry is the study of shape*, and algebra is th*e study o*f generalizat*ions of arith*metic oper*ations. It has two major branc*hes, differen*tial calc*ulus and integ*ral calc*ulus; the form*er concerns instan*taneous rates of change, and the slopes o*f cu*rves, while the latter conce*rns a*ccumulati*on of quan*tities, and are*as under or bet*ween curves. These two branches are related to each other by the fundament*al theorem of calculus, and they make use of the fund*amen*tal noti*ons of conv*ergence of infinite sequ*ences and infini*te ser*ies to a well-defined limit. In*finitesimal calculus was deve*loped ind*ependently in the late 17th ce*ntury by Is*aac Ne*wton and Gottf*ried Wilhelm Leibniz*. Later work, including codi*fying the idea of limits, put these deve*lopments on a more solid conceptual footing. Today, calcul**us has widespread uses in scie*nce, engin*eering, and social science.
